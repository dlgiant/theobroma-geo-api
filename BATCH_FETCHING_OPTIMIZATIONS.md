# Batch Fetching Optimizations Summary

This document summarizes the batch fetching optimizations implemented to eliminate N+1 query problems and improve database performance in the Theobroma Geo API.

## üéØ Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **FarmService.get_all_farms()** - Farm Location Batch Fetching
**Before (N+1 Problem):**
```python
# Original: 1 query for farms + N queries for each farm's location
farms = db.query(Farm).all()  # 1 query
for farm in farms:
    location_result = db.execute(
        text("SELECT ST_Y(...), ST_X(...) FROM farms WHERE id = :farm_id"),
        {"farm_id": farm.id}
    ).fetchone()  # N additional queries
```

**After (Batch Optimization):**
```python
# Optimized: Single query fetches all farms with locations
farms_with_locations = db.execute(text("""
    SELECT 
        f.id, f.name, f.slug, f.total_area_hectares, f.established_date,
        ST_Y(f.location::geometry) as lat, 
        ST_X(f.location::geometry) as lng
    FROM farms f
    ORDER BY f.name
""")).fetchall()  # 1 query total
```

**Performance Improvement:** 5 farms √ó 2 queries = 10 queries ‚Üí **1 query** (90% reduction)

### 2. **LotService.get_lots_summary()** - Lot Tree Metrics Batch Fetching
**Before (N+1 Problem):**
```python
# Original: N queries for each lot's tree metrics
for lot in lots_query:
    trees_data = db.execute(text("""
        SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(maturity_index), ... 
        FROM trees WHERE lot_id = :lot_id
    """), {"lot_id": lot.id}).fetchone()  # N queries
```

**After (Batch Optimization):**
```python
# Optimized: Single query with GROUP BY fetches all lot metrics
lots_data = db.execute(text("""
    SELECT 
        l.lot_number, l.area_hectares,
        COUNT(t.id) as tree_count,
        COALESCE(AVG(t.maturity_index), 0) as avg_maturity,
        COALESCE(AVG(t.fungal_threat_level), 0) as avg_fungal_threat,
        COALESCE(SUM(t.security_events_count), 0) as security_events
    FROM lots l
    LEFT JOIN trees t ON l.id = t.lot_id
    WHERE l.farm_id = :farm_id
    GROUP BY l.id, l.lot_number, l.area_hectares
"""), {"farm_id": farm.id}).fetchall()  # 1 query total
```

**Performance Improvement:** 10 lots √ó 2 queries = 20 queries ‚Üí **2 queries** (90% reduction)

### 3. **AnalyticsService.get_production_analytics()** - Analytics Batch Fetching
**Before (N+1 Problem):**
```python
# Original: N queries for each lot's analytics
for lot in lots:
    lot_data = db.execute(text("""
        SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(maturity_index), AVG(height_meters), ...
        FROM trees WHERE lot_id = :lot_id
    """), {"lot_id": lot.id}).fetchone()  # N queries
```

**After (Batch Optimization):**
```python
# Optimized: Single batch query for all analytics
lots_analytics = db.execute(text("""
    SELECT 
        l.lot_number, l.area_hectares,
        COUNT(t.id) as tree_count,
        COALESCE(AVG(t.maturity_index), 0) as avg_maturity,
        COALESCE(AVG(t.height_meters), 0) as avg_height,
        COALESCE(AVG(t.fungal_threat_level), 0) as avg_fungal_threat
    FROM lots l
    LEFT JOIN trees t ON l.id = t.lot_id
    WHERE l.farm_id = :farm_id
    GROUP BY l.id, l.lot_number, l.area_hectares
"""), {"farm_id": farm.id}).fetchall()  # 1 query total
```

**Performance Improvement:** 8 lots √ó 2 queries = 16 queries ‚Üí **2 queries** (87.5% reduction)

### 4. **Tree Location Fetching** - main.py get_lot_trees()
**Before (N+1 Problem):**
```python
# Original: N queries for each tree's location
trees = trees_query.all()  # 1 query for trees
for tree in trees:
    location_result = db.execute(
        text("SELECT ST_Y(...), ST_X(...) FROM trees WHERE id = :tree_id"),
        {"tree_id": tree.id}
    ).fetchone()  # N additional queries
```

**After (Batch Optimization):**
```python
# Optimized: Single query fetches trees with locations
trees_with_locations = db.execute(text("""
    SELECT 
        t.tree_code, t.variety, t.health_status, 
        t.maturity_index, t.height_meters, t.age_years,
        ST_Y(t.location::geometry) as lat, 
        ST_X(t.location::geometry) as lng
    FROM trees t
    WHERE t.lot_id = :lot_id
    ORDER BY t.tree_code
"""), {"lot_id": lot.id}).fetchall()  # 1 query total
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Key Batch Fetching Patterns Used

1. **Single Query with JOINs**: Replaced multiple queries with optimized JOINs
   ```sql
   SELECT l.*, COUNT(t.id), AVG(t.maturity)
   FROM lots l LEFT JOIN trees t ON l.id = t.lot_id
   GROUP BY l.id
   ```

2. **Geographic Data Integration**: Included PostGIS location queries in main selects
   ```sql
   SELECT f.*, ST_Y(f.location::geometry) as lat, ST_X(f.location::geometry) as lng
   FROM farms f
   ```

3. **Aggregation in Database**: Moved calculations from application to database
   ```sql
   COUNT(CASE WHEN health_status IN ('healthy', 'excellent', 'good') THEN 1 END) as healthy_trees
   ```
